UNEDA is an open-source platform on which decision-analytic software can be built. In its basic form, it can handle methods that conform to classic probability and utility theory, but it can easily be extended to work with any method compatible with additive utilities. UNEDA brings the following features to any implementation:

•	Multiple criteria and probabilistic decisions handled uniformly
•	Imprecise input in the form of intervals or rankings
•	Handling of output overlap from imprecision by belief distributions
•	Multiple decision rules in accordance with utility theory
•	Several types of sensitivity analyses

UNEDA was developed between 1994 and 2025, first at the Royal Institute of Technology and later at Stockholm University. The first implementations were instances of the framework described in the PhD thesis Computational Decision Analysis (Danielson, 1997).  The thesis framework was subsequently extended to handle decision trees of arbitrary depth rather than only a single level (hence the ‘T’ in the layer acronyms) and extended to handle multiple criteria rather than only a single criterion.
